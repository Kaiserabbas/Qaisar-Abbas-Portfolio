<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  I'm Qaisar, your app developer. I sculpt pixels into front-end landscapes and forge backend logic into steel beams, crafting seamless experiences that feel as natural as a sunrise.
</p>

<p>
  With a dynamic background in both software development and agriculture, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and industry experience. As a dedicated Software Developer, I've developed extensive knowledge in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Development, Object-Oriented Programming, Pair-Programming, Test-driven development</li>
  <li>Frontend: Front End Design, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/React, Redux, API, Frameworks, Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Backend: Database-PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, Unit Testing, Deployment, Maintenance</li>
  <li>Test Driven Development: RSpec, Capybara and Jest</li>
  <li>Tools & Methods: Git, GitHub</li>
  <li>Landscape Engineering: AutoCAD, Adobe Photoshop, Premier, 3D Realtime Landscape, PunchPro</li>
  <li>Communication skills: Bridging Cultural Canyons and building bridges of understanding between diverse teams. No matter the language or culture, I weave clear communication tapestries that foster collaboration and synergy.</li>
  <li>Time management: Tasks, time zones, and time itself, I keep everything spinning with a smile, ensuring seamless collaboration even when the clock hands spin at different speeds.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In the past two years, I've embarked on a thrilling journey to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. It hasn't been just about mastering technologies; I've actively honed my communication, collaboration, and problem-solving skills to be a valuable asset to any team. I've built over 15-20 impressive projects, both solo and collaboratively, showcasing my diverse skillset across the tech stacks of HTML/CSS, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux.
</p>

<p>
  I consistently exceeded expectations during my time at Microverse, attaining a remarkable 97.6% project completion rate and scoring a stellar 43.9 out of 45 on the final assessment. This achievement reflects my technical prowess, meticulous work ethic, and unwavering commitment to excellence.
</p>
